We run the upload_file, we choose the file to be uploaded and then submit it.
When we click the submit button the following steps takes place internally <br>
1) fileDetail.getFileName(); <br>
       getFileName() is a function used to return the name of file we are trying to upload. <br>
       we also create a stream to the file.
2) String uploadedFileLocation = "/temp/" + fileDetail.getFileName();<br>
      the filename will be appended to the string "/temp/" which is nothing but we are specifying the path.
     then after appended, we are storing that path in a string type called uploadedFileLocation.
3)writeToFile(uploadedInputStream, uploadedFileLocation); <br>
    We are calling this function and passing the file location and file content to this function. <br>
    uploadedInputStream contains the content of the file we are uploading. <br>
4) Inside this function, a new file will be created with the filename we are passing as an argument. 
    As we also passed the inputStream as an input, we pass the content from the Stream to the new file we are creating. <br>
    Once we complete copying the content we flush the stream and close the file.Then we return to the calling function. <br>
5) Then we will display this message <br>
              "File uploaded to : " + uploadedFileLocation; <br>
              uploadedFileLocation contains the location of the file.
